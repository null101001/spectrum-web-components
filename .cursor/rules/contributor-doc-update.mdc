# Contributor docs navigation and link validation

## When to run the nav script

**1. When the user asks** for any of the following:
- Update contributor docs navigation / nav / TOC / breadcrumbs
- Regenerate contributor docs
- Validate or verify links in contributor docs
- Fix broken links in contributor docs
- CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS or contributor docs with "update", "nav", "links", or "verify"

**2. When you change CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS structure or content:**
- Add, remove, rename, or move files or folders under `CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/`
- Change document H1, H2, or H3 headings

## What to do

1. **Run the nav script** from the authoring-contributor-docs folder:
   ```bash
   cd CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/01_contributor-guides/07_authoring-contributor-docs
   node update-nav.js ../../
   ```
2. **Confirm** the script completes without errors.
3. **Fix any link verification errors** reported by the script (fix straightforward cases; consult the user for ambiguous ones).
4. **Report results** to the user (files updated, link counts, any remaining issues).

Full instructions: `CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS/01_contributor-guides/07_authoring-contributor-docs/01_ai-agent-instructions.md` (Role 1: Operator).

## If the instructions file is missing

If the file above is not found:
1. Search for `**/ai-agent-instructions.md` and find the one in CONTRIBUTOR-DOCS.
2. Read it to confirm it contains the nav update instructions.
3. Update this rule with the correct path, inform the user, then run the nav process.

## Quick reference

- Script updates breadcrumbs, TOC, and validates all links (~20–200ms for the tree).
- Fix broken links automatically when the fix is clear; ask the user when the target is gone or intent is unclear.
